# Cisco Network Projects: Design and Implementation

Welcome to my repository dedicated to **Cisco network design and implementation**! Here, you'll find a collection of hands-on projects where I explore various aspects of Cisco networking, from simple configurations to more complex network designs.

## ðŸ“š Overview

This repository includes multiple Cisco-related projects where I focus on:

- **Network Design**: Creating scalable, efficient, and secure network architectures.
- **Device Configuration**: Implementing configurations on Cisco routers, switches, and other devices.
- **Routing & Switching**: Configuring and testing routing protocols like OSPF, EIGRP, BGP, and implementing VLANs, STP, and more.
- **Network Security**: Implementing access control lists (ACLs), VPNs, and firewall configurations.
- **Troubleshooting & Optimization**: Diagnosing and resolving common network issues, optimizing network performance.

## ðŸ’» Projects

### 1. **Building Network Design and Implementation**
   - Designed and implemented a network from scratch for a small-to-medium-sized organization.
   - Created a topology that included multiple routers, switches, and firewalls.
   - Configured basic routing (static and dynamic), VLANs, inter-VLAN routing, and network security.
   - Set up a simulated environment using GNS3 and Cisco Packet Tracer.

### 2. **Company Network Design and Implementation**
   - Designed a more complex network solution for a medium-sized company, focusing on scalability and security.
   - Implemented multiple LANs and interconnected them through a combination of OSPF and EIGRP.
   - Configured redundancy protocols (HSRP/VRRP) for critical services and created detailed network security policies (ACLs, VPN).
   - Deployed advanced QoS configurations to ensure high-priority traffic (VoIP, business-critical applications).
   - Simulated the entire environment using Cisco hardware and network simulation tools.


## ðŸ”§ Tools and Technologies

- **Cisco Packet Tracer**: For simulating and visualizing network configurations.
- **GNS3**: For running real Cisco images in a virtualized environment.
- **Cisco IOS**: Operating system for Cisco devices.
- **Wireshark**: For monitoring and analyzing network traffic.
